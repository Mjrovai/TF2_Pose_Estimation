# Realtime Multiple Person 2D Pose Estimation using TensorFlow2.x
- Based on tutorial [Pose Estimation with TensorFlow 2.0](https://medium.com/@gsethi2409/pose-estimation-with-tensorflow-2-0-a51162c095ba)
- Developed after the work of [Ildoo Kim](https://github.com/ildoonet) : [tf-pose-estimation](https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation)

'Openpose', human pose estimation algorithm, have been implemented using Tensorflow. It also provides several variants that have some changes to the network structure for real-time processing on the CPU or low-power embedded devices.
